# Jekyll Cyborg Template

This is a quick jekyll template based on the Bootswatch [Cyborg](http://bootswatch.com/cyborg/) theme.
Currently it lacks blog support. To use it, clone this repository and edit the Markdown files. Setting the
```hidden``` paramater of a page to ```true``` will hide it on the Navbar (the home page is hidden by default because clicking the site name on the Navbar will take you there.)
Improvements are welcome, so feel free to make changes and open a pull request!
